## A leaflet-based web app for hiking routes planning.

## [Demo](https://liquidsun.github.io/hallstadt_trips/).

Created for one of the Advanced Cartography course assignements, University of Salzburg.

The app allows to create routes by clicking on the map and see an elevation profiles of created routes.
Routes can be then saved as GeoJSON.

Some other highlights:
- Tourism-related markers are generated dynamically from OpenStreeMap using Overpass API
- Descriptions for popup windows are generated dynamically from wikipedia using OSM palce name tag 
- Pictures for popup windows are generated dynamically from Flickr using place name tag
